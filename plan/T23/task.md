# T23. Guard the interner Marks/sweep contract against interleaved interns

`crates/scull-grid/src/intern.rs:27-32` silently ignores an out-of-range mark, and `sweep()` at `intern.rs:128-142` frees every unmarked slot — a caller that interns between `marks()` and `sweep()` gets live ids reclaimed (wrong styles/text, not UB). The only current call path (`grid.rs:345-360`) is safe today. Done means: `sweep` skips ids at or beyond the marks' length (or the lengths are asserted), so the hazard cannot resurface.
